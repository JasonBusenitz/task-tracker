# Task Tracker

## Often, people have so many tasks to do during any given day that they cannot keep track of them all. Much less prioritize their tasks for maximum efficiency. Task Tracker aims to make the organization of all your daily tasks achievable with as little time or effort invested as possible. 

So we made a website to help you with that! You can organise all your tasks in a very special way. With all of the diffent pages and helpful designs, you can have an easier time getting all of your tasks done.
